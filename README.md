# UFC Data Analysis with Seaborn

This project demonstrates how to use `kagglehub` to download a UFC dataset, load it into a Pandas DataFrame, and create visualizations using Seaborn. The example focuses on creating a pie chart to show the distribution of fights by weight class.

## Overview

The script performs the following steps:
1. Downloads the UFC dataset from Kaggle using `kagglehub`.
2. Loads and merges two CSV files from the dataset: `raw_fights.csv` and `raw_events.csv`.
3. Creates a pie chart using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize the distribution of fights across weight classes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- kagglehub
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Install the required packages:

```bash
